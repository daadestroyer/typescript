# Typescsript Basic Things
Typescript is a superset of Javscript and ECMAScript


## step:1 create typescript file with .ts extension

myfiledemo.ts
-------------
console.log("Hello World...")

## step:2 compiling the code
web browser do not understand TypeScript natively 
have to convert TypeScript code to JavaScript code 
This is known as "transpiling"

transpiling is accomplished with "tsc" command
mydemo.ts -----> mydemo.js

## step:3 run the code
to run javscript code , we use the node command
run the generated javascript code (.js file)

>> node mydemo.js
